# Learning Tools: CoreOS Linux/Fedora CoreOS

Here you'll find Vagrant environments and other resources for learning more about CoreOS/Fedora CoreOS.

**NOTE:** Unless otherwise noted, the examples, code, and configurations in this folder were written for CoreOS as it existed prior to the Red Hat acquisition. Current iterations of CoreOS as distributed by Red Hat may no longer work with the information in this folder.

## Contents

**cloudinit-toolbox**: This folder contains files for using cloud-init to customize the CoreOS toolbox. This learning environment can be used with local Vagrant VMs, with OpenStack instances, or with AWS instances.

**fcos-pulumi-aws**: This folder contains a Pulumi program, written in Go, for standing up a Fedora CoreOS instance on Amazon EC2. As indicated by the use of "Fedora CoreOS", the contents of this folder _are_ up-to-date with later iterations of CoreOS after the Red Hat acquisition.
